## Background

I saw a tweet about a new Firebase Firestore Extension for Stripe's new customer billing portal. This new portal lets end-users change plans and update their billing info via stripe.com instead of in your app--saving you thousands of lines of UI code and headaches.

Anyways, after seeing this, I had to see just how many lines it code it would take to build a minimally viable membership/saas site.
